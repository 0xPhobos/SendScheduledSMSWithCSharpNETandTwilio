# What is Twilio ?

Twilio Programmable Messaging lets you send SMS, MMS, and WhatsApp messages, but up until now, you couldn't schedule messages ahead of time. If you wanted to send messages in the future, you would have to store the message in some data store and then use cron jobs or write some other complicated code to deliver your messages at the right time.

Lucky for you, Programmable Messaging now supports Message Scheduling! With it, you can schedule SMS messages with a single API call. No need for your own complicated scheduling infrastructure.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to schedule SMS's using C# and .NET.
