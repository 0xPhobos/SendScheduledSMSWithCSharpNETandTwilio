# Buy a Twilio Phone Number

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to buy a Twilio phone number. To do that, log in to the Twilio Console, select Phone Numbers, and then click on the **“ Buy a number ”** button. Note that if you have a free account, you will be using your trial credit for this purchase.

On the “Buy a Number” page, select your country and check SMS in the “Capabilities” field. If you’d like to request a number that is local to your region, you can enter your area code in the “Number” field.
