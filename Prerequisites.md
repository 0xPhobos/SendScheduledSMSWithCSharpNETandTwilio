# Prerequisites

You will need these items to follow along:

An OS that supports .NET (Windows/macOS/Linux)
1 - .NET 6 SDK
2 - A code editor or IDE (I recommend VS Code with the C# plugin, Visual Studio, or JetBrains Rider)
3 - A free or paid Twilio account
4 - A phone to receive the SMS's

You can use older versions of .NET, including .NET framework, but you may need to make slight adjustments. For example, instead of using top-level statements, you may need to put the code in the ``Program.Main`` method of your console app.
